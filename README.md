# Seeking Opportunities in [Industry/Field]

I'm a failed to launch person, not even get a space for a job on an entry point. So I can't say that I'm a professional since a professional means you have to be a employee and i'm not able to get through the first wall so i can't be my even minimal expectation of what my friends that exceeds me in any shape or forms.

A proof that I will give to you, what employer wanted throughout the industry will care mostly about quantity not a single point of product and how intricate it is or innovative even on early stage, Low quantity means your Resume will thrown into trash, without a second of thinking.

Or perhaps I need to be on their position to know what's the problem and is this acceptable? I don't know. But I'll probably update it soon enough why they're doing this.
