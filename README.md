This project demonstrates a fundamental principle valued by employers across industries: prioritizing quantity over singularly focusing on product intricacy. In today's competitive landscape, a high volume of work often outweighs individual product intricacies. Failure to deliver on quantity can result in your resume being disregarded without further consideration.
